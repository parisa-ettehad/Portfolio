            <p>A UI designer with 3 years of experience, I thrive in utilizing design tools such as Figma, Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), and Canva and seamlessly collaborating with UX teams and team members. My skill set encompasses creating interactive prototypes and a solid command of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Specializing in responsive design, I prioritize usability, layout, color theory, and typography. A meticulous approach ensures that my designs are pixel-perfect and aligned with the overall vision, while efficient workflow management enables me to meet deadlines across multiple projects. Committed to learning and adaptability, I enthusiastically embrace new tools and methodologies. Open to constructive feedback, I bring a proactive and positive attitude. Fluent in English and currently learning French, I am eager to contribute to the success of your team.</p>
